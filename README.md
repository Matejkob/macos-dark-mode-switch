## Overview

DarkModeSwitch solves a common macOS limitation: the system doesn't offers automatic dark/light mode switching, users cannot set custom times for when these switches occur. This lightweight menu bar app gives you full control over your appearance schedule.

## Features

- üåô **Menu Bar Integration**: Lives discretely in your menu bar
- ‚ö° **Quick Toggle**: Instantly switch between dark and light modes with a click or keyboard shortcut (‚åò‚áßA)
- ‚è∞ **Custom Scheduling**: Set your own times for automatic dark/light mode switching

## Requirements

- macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later

2. Move `DarkModeSwitch.app` to your Applications folder
3. Launch the app - you'll see the icon appear in your menu bar
4. Grant the necessary permissions when prompted

## Architecture

DarkModeSwitch is built with modern Swift and SwiftUI, following clean architecture principles:

- **Modular Design**: Core functionality is separated into Swift packages
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clear separation between views and business logic
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit tests with spy objects for all major components
